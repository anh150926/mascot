# The RML format

RML is an XML projection of Rive's object model. There is no separate schema to

learn: **every element is a core type, every attribute is one of its properties,

and nesting stands in for the references those objects hold to each other.**

One `.rml` file describes a whole Rive file. `rive` compiles it to both outputs:

the runtime `.riv`, and the editor-openable `.rev`.

If you know the type you want, ask the tool rather than guessing:

```bash

rive schema Rectangle

```

## Read this first: build success is a weak signal

Misspelled names *are* caught -- `<Rect>` is a build error suggesting

`<Rectangle>`, and an unknown attribute names the property you probably meant.

You never have to wonder whether a name landed.

What survives a clean build is everything where the names are right and the

wiring is wrong: a bind pointing at a property that does not exist, a bind on

the wrong object, a type mismatch, a script input matching no field. Each

produces a file that loads, renders, and quietly does the wrong thing.

So two habits:

1. Look names up rather than inventing them: `rive schema --search`

   (`--json` on any `rive schema` form for a machine-readable answer).

2. Check what you built, not that the build succeeded:

```bash

rive inspect . --summary

rive inspect . --json

```

`problems` lists what is wired wrong; the summary counts what was really

produced by type, and `--json` shows the tree.

## Document structure

A document is a `<Rive>` root holding a flat sequence of root elements — a

forest under one wrapper, not a single tree:

```xml

<Rive version="1" kind="fragment">

    <Artboard defaultStateMachineId="0:7" width="500" height="500" name="Artboard" id="0:2">

        ...scene content...

    </Artboard>

    <ViewModel name="Settings" id="0:50">...</ViewModel>

    <ScriptAsset file="main.luau" name="main" id="0:80"/>

</Rive>

```

`<Rive>` carries two attributes, both required: `version="1"`, and

`kind="fragment"`, which every project file uses.

A project may hold any number of `.rml` files, in any folders. They compile as

one document: an id declared in one file can be referenced from another, an id

may not repeat across files, and a problem is reported against the file it is

in. Split by whatever reads well, artboards in one file and view models in

another, say. Files compile in path order, so that is the order artboards take

in the `.riv` and what "first artboard declared" means for `main`; name the

default artboard in `rive.yaml` rather than relying on a filename sorting

first.

Artboards hold scene content. Assets, view models, data converters and enums are

**root elements**, direct children of `<Rive>` and never nested inside an

artboard.

Do not write a `<Backboard>`. File-level settings — the default artboard and

the publish options — live in `rive.yaml`; see

[project/rive-yaml.md](project/rive-yaml.md).

An artboard's own `x` and `y` are its position on the editor's stage. Nothing

the CLI shows uses them, so a file with several artboards builds and runs

fine without any, but it opens in the editor with every artboard stacked at

the origin. Space them out when there is more than one, by their sizes plus

a gutter.

## Ids and references

An id is a numeric pair, `client:object` — `0:12`, `14:11981`. Anything else

is a compile error — leading zeros included (`04:23` is malformed, not an

alternate spelling of `4:23`) — and the `0:0` id is reserved.

A project created from an editor file (`create --from-rev`) already carries an

id on every element — those are the file's identities, preserved through build

and push; keep them.

It is valid for an element which isn't referenced anywhere in the file to not

have an id. It gets one at build and push, and `rive` writes that id back into

your `.rml` — so an element you left without one comes back with one, and keeps

it from then on. A layer's missing `AnyState` and `ExitState` are written in the

same way, ids and all, as the layer's first children.

That write-back is what holds identity across rebuilds and pushes: without it

the same element can be handed a different number the next time the numbering

shifts, and a push then reads it as a delete and an add rather than an edit.

Anything `excludeFromRev` drops gets no id written back.

They share **one namespace across the whole document**, not one per element

type. A `DataConverterGroupItem` and a `StateMachineLayer` cannot both be

`0:91`, even though nothing could ever confuse the two. Reusing one is a build

failure — `duplicate id "0:91"; every authored id must be unique` — so this

costs you a build rather than a debugging session, but it does mean a document

assembled from two examples that each start numbering at `0:10` will not

compile until you renumber one of them.

References are attributes holding another element's id, and they are always

named `<something>Id`: `styleId`, `scriptAssetId`, `fontAssetId`, `objectId`.

A reference to an id no element declares is a compile error (id lists and

the editor's dangling marker `0:0` excepted).

Most references you never write, because nesting sets them for you.

Nesting one element inside another sets a reference property on one of them. Which property, and which direction, is declared per property in the core defs.

### The child references its parent

Nest one of these inside an element of the referenced type and the property is filled in for you. The referent is found by walking **up** to the nearest matching ancestor, so it need not be the immediate parent.

| Element | Property set | Referenced type |

|---|---|---|

| `Animation` | `artboardId` | `Artboard` |

| `Asset` | `parentId` | `Asset` |

| `BlendAnimation` | `blendStateId` | `BlendState` |

| `CodeComponent` | `codeFileId` | `CodeFile` |

| `CodePoint` | `lineId` | `CodeLine` |

| `CodeRun` | `lineId` | `CodeLine` |

| `Component` | `parentId` | `ContainerComponent` |

| `DataBind` | `targetId` | `ViewModelInstance` |

| `DataConverterGroupItem` | `groupId` | `DataConverterGroup` |

| `DataEnumValue` | `enumId` | `DataEnum` |

| `FileAssetContents` | `assetId` | `FileAsset` |

| `FormulaToken` | `formulaId` | `DataConverterFormula` |

| `KeyFrame` | `keyedPropertyId` | `KeyedProperty` |

| `KeyboardInput`, `GamepadInput`, `SemanticInput` | `targetId` | the matching `ListenerInputType*` |

| `KeyedObject` | `animationId` | `Animation` |

| `KeyedProperty` | `keyedObjectId` | `KeyedObject` |

| `LayerState` | `layerId` | `StateMachineLayer` |

| `LibraryArtboard` | `assetId` | `LibraryAsset` |

| `LibraryDataEnum` | `assetId` | `LibraryAsset` |

| `LibraryEvent` | `artboardId` | `LibraryArtboard` |

| `LibraryViewModel` | `assetId` | `LibraryAsset` |

| `ListenerAction` | `listenerId` | `StateMachineLayerComponent` or `StateMachineListener` |

| `ListenerInputType*` | `listenerId` | `StateMachineListener` |

| `ParentableDataItem` | `parentId` | `ParentableDataItem` |

| `ScriptInput*` | `scriptedObjectId` | the `Scripted*` object it feeds |

| `StateMachineComponent` | `folderId` | `StateMachineComponentFolder` |

| `StateMachineComponent` | `machineId` *(fallback)* | `StateMachine` |

| `StateMachineFireAction` | `layerComponentId` | `StateMachineLayerComponent` |

| `StateTransition` | `stateFromId` | `LayerState` |

| `TransitionCondition` | `transitionId` | `StateTransition` |

| `ViewModelInstance` | `viewModelId` | `ViewModel` |

| `ViewModelInstanceListItem` | `instanceListId` | `ViewModelInstanceList` |

| `ViewModelInstanceValue` | `viewModelInstanceId` | `ViewModelInstance` |

| `ViewModelProperty` | `viewModelId` | `ViewModel` |

### The parent references its child

These invert: nest the referenced type **inside** the element, and the element points at it.

| Element | Property set | Referenced type (as a child) |

|---|---|---|

| `BlendAnimationDirect` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |

| `BlendState1DViewModel` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |

| `DataConverterInterpolator` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |

| `DataConverterRangeMapper` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |

| `InterpolatingKeyFrame` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |

| `LayoutComponentStyle` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |

| `ListenerViewModelChange` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |

| `StateTransition` | `interpolatorId` | `KeyFrameInterpolator` |

| `TransitionPropertyViewModelComparator` | `bindablePropertyId` | `BindableProperty` |

| `TransitionViewModelCondition` | `leftComparatorId` | `TransitionComparator` |

| `TransitionViewModelCondition` | `rightComparatorId` | `TransitionComparator` |

### Referenced but not parented

Declared as a reference with no parenting implication; these are resolved by other rules and may need an explicit id.

- `BindableProperty.dataBindId`

### Linked by nesting alone

A few types carry no reference in either direction — being a child *is* the

whole link, and there is no id to get wrong:

- **`LayoutParticipant`** inside the `Shape`, `Text` or `Image` it puts into the

  layout flow — see [layout.md](layout.md#shapes-and-text-inside-a-layout-box)

- **`GridTrack`** inside the grid `LayoutComponent` — not its style — and

  **`GridItemPlacement`** inside the item it places; see

  [layout.md](layout.md#grid)

- **`ComponentOrigin`** inside the `LayoutComponent` whose pivot it sets

- **`TextStyleAxis`** inside its `TextStylePaint`

- **`Mesh`** inside the `Image` it deforms, and a `Skin` inside that `Mesh` or a

  `PointsPath` — see [rigging.md](rigging.md#skinning)

Contrast `LayoutComponentStyle`, which nests **and** needs `styleId`. The

difference is not guessable, so check which kind you are dealing with rather

than assuming.

Two consequences worth internalising:

**The referent is the nearest matching ancestor, not necessarily the parent.**

A `StateMachineComponent` inside a folder inside a state machine gets *both*

`folderId` (the folder) and `machineId` (the state machine, two levels up).

**Some references point down, not up.** A `KeyFrameInterpolator` nested inside a

`StateTransition` sets the *transition's* `interpolatorId`. The child is the

thing being pointed at.

## Listeners

A listener is a `StateMachineListenerSingle` declared inside the state machine.

It carries both what it watches (`targetId`) and what gesture it responds to

(`listenerTypeValue`), and its action nests inside it:

```xml

<StateMachine name="State Machine 1" id="0:7">

    <StateMachineListenerSingle targetId="0:14" listenerTypeValue="click" name="Listener 1">

        <ListenerViewModelChange>

            <BindablePropertyBoolean propertyValue="true">

                <DataBindContext sourcePathIds="0:40-0:46" propertyKey="634" direction="true"/>

            </BindablePropertyBoolean>

        </ListenerViewModelChange>

    </StateMachineListenerSingle>

    ...

</StateMachine>

```

`ListenerViewModelChange` writes a view model property; see

[data.md](data.md#writing-a-value-back-from-a-listener).

`listenerTypeValue` accepts `enter`, `exit`, `down`, `up`, `move`, `click` and

more — `rive schema StateMachineListenerSingle` lists them all.

Older files use `ListenerTriggerChange`, `ListenerBoolChange` and

`ListenerNumberChange` to set deprecated state machine inputs; see

[state-machines.md](state-machines.md#from-inputs-deprecated).

### Listeners: two spellings

`StateMachineListenerSingle` is a listener with **one trigger folded into the

element**: `listenerTypeValue` (click, enter, drag, …) sits on the listener

itself. `StateMachineListener` is the general form: the element carries only

`targetId`, and **each trigger is a nested `ListenerInputType*` child** with

its own `listenerTypeValue` — several children make a listener that reacts to

several things. Keyboard and gamepad listeners are always the general form,

because their input types are what the key/button filters nest under:

```xml

<!-- 0:2 must own a <FocusData/> child; see focus.md -->

<StateMachineListener targetId="0:2" name="Arrows">

    <ListenerInputTypeKeyboard listenerTypeValue="keyboard">

        <KeyboardInput keyType="right" keyPhase="1"/>

        <KeyboardInput keyType="left" keyPhase="1"/>

    </ListenerInputTypeKeyboard>

    <ScriptedListenerAction scriptAssetId="0:80"/>

</StateMachineListener>

```

`keyType` names a key: `right`, `escape`, `a`, `f1`, `kpEnter`, and so on. The

four arrows also answer to `arrowRight`, `arrowLeft`, `arrowUp`, `arrowDown`.

Leaving it off, or writing `any`, matches every key. `rive schema

KeyboardInput` lists the set.

**Choose the phases you want.** `keyPhase` is a bitmask over the three

phases of one keystroke, and you add the bits you want:

| Bits | Means |

|---|---|

| `1` | down, the initial press |

| `2` | repeat, each auto-repeat tick while the key is held |

| `4` | up, the release |

A navigation listener wants `1`, or `3` to keep moving while the key is held.

`7` is all three, so one press fires the listener on the way down *and* again

on the way up, moving the selection twice. `0`, the default, matches nothing

at all, which makes the listener dead.

Combining only ever means "fire this more than once per keystroke", because

most listener actions cannot tell which phase they ran for. `3` is the one

combination with an obvious use.

`modifiers` is the same idea over `1` shift, `2` ctrl, `4` alt, `8` meta, but

it is matched **exactly**, not as a subset. `0` means the key with no

modifiers at all, and a listener that leaves it at `0` will not fire while

shift is held — which is why Tab and Shift+Tab need two separate inputs.

The nesting is the whole link: no `listenerId` on the input type, no

`targetId` on the inputs. An input type with no inputs matches every key, so

a `KeyboardInput` left outside its input type would silently widen the

listener to everything; that misplacement is a build error rather than a

quiet one. Note `listenerTypeValue` lives on

`ListenerInputType*` for these, and on `StateMachineListenerSingle` for a

pointer listener; the two are different types, and mixing them is a build

error. If a construct is not in the tables above, check with

`rive schema <Type>` which shape it uses.

## Nested artboards

A `NestedArtboard` embeds another artboard by id. The source artboard must be a

component — marked `isComponent="true"` and listed by a `ComponentAsset` — or

the file is malformed. See

[making an artboard nestable](#making-an-artboard-nestable) below.

```xml

<Artboard width="600" height="400" name="Screen" id="0:1">

    <NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="120" y="200" name="Left">

        <NestedStateMachine animationId="0:35" name="SM">

            <NestedBool inputId="0:36" nestedValue="true" name="on"/>

        </NestedStateMachine>

    </NestedArtboard>

</Artboard>

<Artboard isComponent="true" defaultStateMachineId="0:35" width="80" height="40" name="Switch" id="0:30">

    ...

</Artboard>

<ComponentAsset artboardId="0:30" name="Switch"/>

```

To drive the child's state machine inputs from the parent, nest a

`NestedStateMachine` naming the child's machine, and inside it a `NestedBool`,

`NestedNumber` or `NestedTrigger` naming the input. The value goes on

`nestedValue`, not `value`.

`NestedArtboardLeaf` is the lighter variant. It adds `fit` and

`alignmentX`/`alignmentY`, which control how the child is scaled into the space

the parent gives it — relevant when the leaf sits in a layout that sizes it. For

a leaf positioned by plain `x`/`y` the default `fill` is effectively a no-op.

### Driving the child's timelines

A state machine is not the only thing a parent can reach into. Two more children

of a `NestedArtboard` drive one of the child's `LinearAnimation`s directly,

naming it with `animationId` the same way `NestedStateMachine` names a machine:

```xml

<!-- play it: speed, mix and a playback flag -->

<NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="300" y="100" name="Spinner">

    <NestedSimpleAnimation animationId="0:35" isPlaying="true" speed="2" name="Play"/>

</NestedArtboard>

<!-- or scrub it from data -->

<NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="100" y="100" name="Dial">

    <NestedRemapAnimation animationId="0:35" name="Scrub">

        <DataBindContext sourcePathIds="0:60-0:62" propertyKey="202"/>

    </NestedRemapAnimation>

</NestedArtboard>

```

`NestedRemapAnimation` is the more useful of the two. Its `time` is

**animatable and bindable**, which makes a component's whole timeline

addressable as a single number — bind a `0`–`1` view model property to it and a

gauge, a progress ring or a character pose scrubs from data, with no state

machine on either side.

**`time` is a fraction of the duration, not seconds**, whatever `rive schema`

says: the runtime multiplies it by the animation's length. `0.5` is halfway

through, and `30` is not thirty seconds, it is thirty times past the end.

`NestedSimpleAnimation` plays instead of scrubbing, and its `isPlaying`

**defaults to `false`** — nest one without it and the child simply holds its

first frame. `speed` scales playback, and `mix` (on both, defaulting to `1`) is

how strongly the animation applies, so several can blend.

Both are only valid as a direct child of a `NestedArtboard`. Put one anywhere

else and it is dropped during load, silently — it does not fail the file, and

`--verify` and `problems` see nothing wrong.

### Making an artboard nestable

An artboard cannot be nested until it has been promoted to a component. In the

editor that is three steps: build the artboard, mark it as a component, and it

appears in the assets panel — only then can it be dropped into another artboard.

RML is the same sequence written out, with one difference: **the editor creates

the assets-panel entry for you, and in markup you write it yourself.** That

entry is the `ComponentAsset`.

```xml

<!-- 1. the artboard, 2. marked as a component -->

<Artboard isComponent="true" width="80" height="40" name="Switch" id="0:30">

    ...

</Artboard>

<!-- 3. its entry in the assets panel -->

<ComponentAsset artboardId="0:30" name="Switch"/>

<!-- 4. now it can be nested -->

<Artboard width="600" height="400" name="Screen" id="0:1">

    <NestedArtboard artboardId="0:30" x="120" y="200" name="Left"/>

</Artboard>

```

`ComponentAsset` is a root element carrying only `artboardId` and `name` — no

file, nothing nested. One per component artboard.

All four steps are required. Skipping the mark or the asset entry produces a

file the editor would never have created, so treat them as one action: an

artboard meant for reuse gets `isComponent="true"` **and** a `ComponentAsset`,

written together.

Both build clean. `rive inspect` warns: `nested-artboard-not-component` for a

`NestedArtboard` pointing at an unmarked artboard, and `component-without-asset`

for a component with no asset entry. Older editor files may nest unmarked

artboards; write all four steps in anything new.

## Values

**Colors** are ARGB hex, no `#`: `colorValue="FFFF5A3C"` is opaque orange.

**Booleans** are `"true"` / `"false"`.

**Enums** accept a symbolic name or the underlying integer —

`layoutWidthScaleType="fill"` and `="1"` are identical. Prefer names; the

integers are what the `.rev` decompiler emits. An unrecognised name *is* an

error, and lists the accepted values, which makes enums the one place a typo is

caught for you. `rive schema <Type>` lists the names per property.

**Rotation is radians**, not degrees. A full turn is `6.2831855`.

**Fractional indices** are a fraction written as a string: `childOrder="3/4"`.

The type exists so a row can be inserted between two others without renumbering

the rest — pick any fraction that sorts between the neighbours. It appears on

`Component.childOrder` and on the `order` of folders, tags, enum values and view

model list items.

The slash is not optional, and this is the trap: `childOrder="1"` is not the

integer 1, it is a **malformed** fractional index. It does not error — a literal

with no `/` parses to the type's `invalid` value, so the ordering you wrote is

ignored and nothing tells you. Write `"1/1"`.

**Animation timing is frames.** `LinearAnimation` has `fps` (default 60) and

`duration` in frames, so two seconds at 60fps is `duration="120"`. Transition

durations, confusingly, are milliseconds.

**Inline source** for scripts and shaders goes in a CDATA block:

```xml

<ScriptAsset name="inline_main" id="0:80">

<![CDATA[

return function(context: Context): Layout<Inline>

    ...

end

]]>

</ScriptAsset>

```

When both `file` and inline text are present, the file wins.

## Animation

Keyframes address their target by **property name**, looked up on the type of

the object the `KeyedObject` animates:

```xml

<LinearAnimation loopValue="loop" duration="120" name="Spin" id="0:6">

    <KeyedObject objectId="0:14">

        <KeyedProperty property="rotation">

            <KeyFrameDouble value="0" interpolationType="linear"/>

            <KeyFrameDouble value="6.2831855" interpolationType="linear" frame="120"/>

        </KeyedProperty>

    </KeyedObject>

</LinearAnimation>

```

Never guess the name; list what can be keyed:

```bash

rive schema Shape --animatable

```

The name only means something on that type -- `x` is one property on a `Node`

and another on a vertex -- so the `KeyedObject` needs an `objectId` naming an

object. The numeric `propertyKey="15"` still works, and is what a property the

type does not name uniquely is written as; give one or the other, or both only

if they agree.

Note `KeyedObject.objectId` is one of the few references you write explicitly —

the animation lives beside the objects it animates, not inside them.

### The keyframe type must match the property

`KeyFrameDouble` is only for `double` properties. Every field type has its own

keyframe element, and the one you nest has to match the property it keys:

| Property type | Keyframe |

|---|---|

| `double` | `KeyFrameDouble` |

| `Color` | `KeyFrameColor` |

| `bool` | `KeyFrameBool` |

| `uint` (including enums) | `KeyFrameUint` |

| `String` | `KeyFrameString` |

| `Id` | `KeyFrameId` |

| `callback` | `KeyFrameCallback` |

`rive schema <Type>` gives the type of any property, and `--animatable` lists

only the ones that can be keyed at all.

A `callback` property carries no value — `KeyFrameCallback` takes a `frame` and

nothing else, and firing it *does* something rather than setting something. See

[luau/protocols.md](luau/protocols.md#the-trigger-has-two-keys) for the one you

are most likely to key.

Two common non-double cases:

```xml

<!-- fade a fill from blue to red: 0:20 is its SolidColor -->

<KeyedObject objectId="0:20">

    <KeyedProperty property="colorValue">

        <KeyFrameColor value="FF57A5E0" frame="0" interpolationType="linear"/>

        <KeyFrameColor value="FFE0573C" frame="60" interpolationType="linear"/>

    </KeyedProperty>

</KeyedObject>

<!-- switch which child of a Solo is showing: 0:60 is the Solo -->

<KeyedObject objectId="0:60">

    <KeyedProperty property="activeComponentId">

        <KeyFrameId value="0:61" frame="0" interpolationType="hold"/>

        <KeyFrameId value="0:62" frame="30" interpolationType="hold"/>

    </KeyedProperty>

</KeyedObject>

```

Reference and boolean keyframes only make sense as `hold` — there is no halfway

between two ids. Colours interpolate channel by channel.

Mismatching them fails silently. A `KeyFrameDouble` on a colour property builds

without complaint, `rive inspect` reports nothing, and at runtime the value is

never written — the property just sits at its authored value while the timeline

plays. If a keyed property refuses to animate and everything looks right, check

the keyframe element before anything else.

## State machines

Every `StateMachineLayer` needs an `EntryState`; without one the layer does

not import. `AnyState` and `ExitState` are added for you when a layer omits

them, and written back into your `.rml` like an id, because older runtimes and

the editor refuse a layer without both. Write them yourself when you need their

transitions or want to place them.

```xml

<StateMachine name="State Machine 1" id="0:7">

    <StateMachineLayer name="Layer 1" id="0:8">

        <AnyState/>

        <ExitState/>

        <EntryState>

            <StateTransition stateToId="0:12"/>

        </EntryState>

        <AnimationState animationId="0:6" id="0:12"/>

    </StateMachineLayer>

</StateMachine>

```

An artboard plays a state machine automatically when its `defaultStateMachineId`

names one.

This section covers the grammar only. Exit time, transition flags, view model

conditions, multiple layers and events are in

[state-machines.md](state-machines.md).

## Data binding

`DataBindContext` nests under the object it drives, naming the target property

by key and the source by path:

```xml

<TextValueRun styleId="0:21" text="placeholder" name="Run">

    <DataBindContext sourcePathIds="0:40-0:45" propertyKey="268"/>

</TextValueRun>

```

`sourcePathIds` is a dash-separated **absolute** path: it starts at a view model

id and walks property ids. `"0:40-0:45"` means view model `0:40`, its property

`0:45`. To reach through a nested view model, add a segment — the middle segment

must be a `ViewModelPropertyViewModel`, and the walk continues inside the view

model it references.

Relative paths are not supported. Bind the deepest concrete property directly.

A dangling path is not an error. A bind whose `sourcePathIds` names a property

that does not exist compiles, loads, and silently does nothing — so verify with

`rive inspect` rather than assuming.

Bind the property that actually exists on the target: `width` lives on

`Rectangle`, not on the enclosing `Shape`. Binding `propertyKey="20"` under the

`Shape` compiles and does nothing.

## Limits

Authoring these will fail or silently diverge from what the editor produces:

- **Bind paths are absolute.** The relative (`nameBased`) form the editor emits

  resolves through a `ManifestAsset` nothing here builds, so setting the flag by

  hand produces a bind that never resolves — see

  [gotchas.md](gotchas.md#bind-paths-you-author-here-are-absolute).

- **A `LibraryAsset` needs its content downloaded.** The element can be authored

  fine, but what it names lives under `.libraries/`, which `rive pull` writes.

  Without it the build warns and exports the file without what that library

  supplied. See [project/rive-yaml.md](project/rive-yaml.md#libraries).

- **No treeshaking.** Everything authored is exported, except an image, PSD

  layer, font, audio or blob asset with `exportFlags="2"`, which is dropped.

- Keyframe interpolators are not deduplicated.

- Scripts and shaders always embed; `exportTypeValue` only applies to images

  (PSD layers included), fonts, audio and blobs. See

  [assets.md](assets.md#referenced-and-hosted-assets).
